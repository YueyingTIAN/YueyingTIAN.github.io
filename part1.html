        To my understanding, computational thinking is a logical way of understanding and solving problems based on
        computer science related basic concepts and related components. Computational thinking includes
        <b>decomposition</b>, <b>pattern recognition</b>, <b>abstraction</b>, <b>algorithm</b>, and
        <b>generalisation</b>. Decomposition and pattern
        recognition
        divide complex problems or tasks into simple manageable sub-problems or sub-tasks. Abstraction is to remove
        information that has nothing to do with the solution of the problem and retain relevant information. Algorithms
        are
        specific
        logic and steps to solve problems. Generalisation is the application of algorithms to new problems.

        Consider the following example, i.e.,
        we want to provide tea to a group of guests. First, we break down the task of making a cup of tea into a
        series
        of steps: boiling water, putting tea bags, making tea, filtering tea, and pouring tea. In this process, we
        identified some patterns: such as the water temperature range, and the time to make tea. We have removed
        some
        irrelevant information through abstraction, for example, using what kind of teacup and kettle. We perform
        specific
        steps, which is equivalent to implementing specific algorithms. Finally, we can use the same method to make
        many
        cups of tea to serve multiple people, which corresponds to generalisation.

        In general, computational thinking is about how to think in a computational way to simplify and solve
        problems, and our future courses will realise this
        way of thinking by designing algorithms and writing programmes. For example, in the future, we will learn
        some commonly
        used algorithms and data structures to study how to solve specific problems efficiently. Designing
        algorithms to solve
        problems requires us to have a logical way of thinking, which is the computational thinking in this module.
        Therefore,
        computational thinking is important for learning more advanced courses in my study of computer science
        programme.
