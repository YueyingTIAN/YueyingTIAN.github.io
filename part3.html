            In this module, we mainly learned the following four sets of skills.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            First, as aforementioned in the first part, we learned <b>computational thinking</b>, which is an effective
            and logical way of
            thinking for solving problems. Using the methods we have learned, including <em>decomposition</em>, <em>pattern
            recognition</em>, <em>abstraction</em>, <em>algorithm</em>, and <em>generalisation</em>, we can effectively decompose and solve
            complex problems in a manageable way, such as the task of making tea for a group of people.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            Second, we learned how data is represented in a computer machine, using binary and other number systems.
            First of all, because of the underlying hardware of a computer is implemented using integrated circuits,
            and the voltage level in the circuits can represent two different states: high voltage and low voltage,
            which correspond to the two numbers 0 and 1. Therefore, binary representation is a very natural choice
            for computers. By converting decimal numbers into binary (octal, hexadecimal) numbers, we can store the
            data in the computer. Vice versa, by converting the binary numbers into a decimal system, we can read
            and understand the data stored in computers.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            Third, we learned some basic programming languages and algorithms. We operate on the data in computers by
            writing programs to realize the algorithm logics
            and solutions to the problems mentioned earlier. Specifically, we learned about the sequential execution
            of programs, loops and conditional statements, which constitute the basic elements of all algorithms.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">  
            Finally, we learned how to display the data in the computer in a way that humans can understand. We have
            learned HTML and CSS languages, where HTML can be used to design web pages, which can display text, pictures,
            videos and other content, and CSS can be used to design and customize styles of web pages.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            In retrospect, I learned the methodology of solving problems from both the theoretical and the practical
            sides, including how to think
            in a computational way, how to use computers to represent data, how to use programming languages to
            manipulate data, and how to display the data in the computer.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            Future courses will be a more in-depth study of these four aspects. For example, in the future, we could
            design more
            complicated programmes, do more advanced research study, and solve real problems using computer science
            techniques,
            all of which require the above basic knowledge we learned in this module. This module helps us lay a good
            foundation
            (e.g., the previously mentioned sequential execution, loops and conditional statements, etc.), which is
            indispensable
            for our future learning.
