            Alan Turing (1912-1954), was a British computer scientist. Nowadays, he is widely acknowledged as the father
            of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:white">
            First of all, in theoretical computer science, he first proposed the concept of Turing machine, to study
            what
            kind of problems can be solved by computational
            machines, and rigorously proved that the halting problem cannot be calculated. This opened up the research
            on
            the computability theory, and for the first time made people realize that the range of capabilities of
            computers
            is limited, and computers cannot solve all problems, which is very fundamental for people to understand
            computers more deeply. Today, computability theory and computational complexity theory (to study what kinds
            of
            problems can be efficiently solved by computers in terms of time and space) are still the core research
            topics
            of the theoretical computer community.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:white">
            Secondly, Turing also had pioneering contributions in artificial intelligence. He first proposed the concept
            of
            the Turing test, attempting to provide a formal definition of
            artificial intelligence. Turing considered that if a human interrogator cannot tell the difference between a
            computer machine and a human being by communicating with them separately, then the computer can be
            considered
            to achieve intelligent behaviour. To this day, the academic community is still working hard to achieve the
            ultimate goal of artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:white">
            Finally, during the World War II, Turing was responsible for participating in the deciphering of German
            secret
            military codes, and together with colleagues, he successfully
            deciphered the German cryptography system, Enigma, so that the Allied forces had a full grasp of German
            military
            intelligence, which played a very crucial role to ending the war early. His research on cryptanalysis has
            been
            only known after a long time due to confidentiality reasons. Cryptography is also an important branch of
            computer science today, and it has very important applications in Internet security, privacy, and so on.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:white">
            To summarize, Turing has made groundbreaking contributions in several important computer science related
            fields
            (computability theory, artificial intelligence, and cryptography), which established his position as the
            founder
            of computer science in the history, and therefore significantly influenced the development of computer
            science
            as a whole.
